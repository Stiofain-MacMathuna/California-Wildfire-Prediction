# California Wildfire Prediction Model

**Academic Project | MSc Computer Science | Grade: A**

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the size of California wildfires based on historical weather and incident data (2013-2020). It demonstrates a complete data science lifecycle, moving from raw data inspection and cleaning to building a deployable predictive model.

## Key Outcomes
* **Data Quality & EDA:** Performed rigorous quality checks, handling missing values and outliers across complex meteorological datasets.
* **Data Pipeline:** Engineered a robust pipeline to merge weather data with fire incident reports.
* **Modeling:** Trained and evaluated Linear, Ridge, Lasso, and Random Forest regressors.
* **Optimization:** Utilized GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning to minimize RMSE.
